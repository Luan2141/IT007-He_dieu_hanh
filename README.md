# Operating System Labs

## LAB 1: INSTALLING UBUNTU and SHELL'S BASIC COMMANDS
- **Objective:** 
  - Learn how to install Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine or physical hardware.
  - Understand basic shell commands for file navigation, manipulation, and system management.
  - Practice commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and others.

## LAB 2: PROGRAMMING IN SHELL
- **Objective:** 
  - Learn to write and execute shell scripts in Bash.
  - Automate tasks using conditional statements, loops, and functions in shell scripts.
  - Understand how to interact with the system using shell commands programmatically.

## LAB 3: PROCESS and THREADS
- **Objective:** 
  - Understand the concepts of processes and threads in an operating system.
  - Learn how to create, manage, and terminate processes and threads using system calls.
  - Explore process control, process scheduling, and thread synchronization.

## LAB 4: CPU SCHEDULING
- **Objective:** 
  - Study various CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and others.
  - Implement and simulate CPU scheduling to understand their behavior and efficiency.
  - Analyze how the scheduler selects processes for execution and their impact on performance.

## LAB 5: PROCESS SYNCHRONIZATION
- **Objective:** 
  - Understand the challenges and techniques for synchronizing processes in a multi-threaded environment.
  - Learn about mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.
  - Solve common synchronization problems like the Producer-Consumer problem or the Dining Philosophers problem.

## LAB 6: VIRTUAL MEMORY
- **Objective:** 
  - Learn the concept of virtual memory and its role in process isolation and memory management.
  - Study paging, segmentation, and the role of the Memory Management Unit (MMU).
  - Simulate or analyze how the operating system handles page faults and memory allocation.
